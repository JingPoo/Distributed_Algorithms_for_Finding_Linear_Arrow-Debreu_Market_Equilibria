# Distributed_Algorithms_for_Finding_Linear_Arrow-Debreu_Market_Equilibria
In this work, we study how to find a linear Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium using distributed update algorithms. We propose various programs based on the convex program formulated by Devanur et al. and solve them with different distributed algorithms. In one of our designs, we transformed the original constrained convex optimization problem into an unconstrained minimax problem using Lagrange multipliers. We then solve it with the optimistic gradient descent ascent algorithm, and demonstrate through theoretical analysis and numerical experimental simulations that our proposed solution will eventually converge to a market equilibrium with at least a linear convergence rate.
